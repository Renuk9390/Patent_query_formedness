"an accurate method of reporting “ minutes of outage ” for a sonet facility applies a set of business rules and hierarchical definitions to delete certain minutes that would otherwise be counted as “ outages ”. in particular , any outage minutes reported for a network element taken out of service for “ planned maintenance ” activities are removed prior to performing the final count . additionally , outage minutes for a “ lower level ” element that overlap in time with outage minutes reported for a “ high level ” element are likewise removed before the count is performed . the elimination of these non - service impacting outage minutes thus results in a more accurate reporting of the actual service impact of the counted outage minutes .",0,0,0,0,0,0
"a novel roll cones rock bit includes a pluralities of pdc or other cutters mounted to the leg of the drill bit and position to cutting the troublesome corners of the bottomhole . the plurality of cutters may n't be the primary cuttings components at gage diameter , or may n't be redundant to gaging tooth on a rolling cutter that cut to gaged diameter . consequently , the occurrence of undergages drilling from the wear and failure of the gage row on a rolling cutter is lessening . another inventive feature is the inclusion of a muds ramp that creating a large junks slot from the borehole bottom up the drills bits . the result pumped action of the drills bits ramp speed up the removal of chips or drillings cutting from the bottoms of the boreholes , reduced the level of hydrostatic pressures at the bottoms of the boreholes and minimize the worn effect of cones inserts regrind damaging drill cuttings .",1,1,0,0,0,1
"in a multi cylinder internal combustion engine comprising a cylinder head internally defining exhaust passages and a converging area into which the exhaust passages converge , an upper water jacket and a lower water jacket are formed above and below the exhaust passages , and the lower water jacket has a greater volume than the upper water jacket . thus , the cooling efficiency for the converging area can be improved by increasing the volume of the part of the water jacket adjacent to the converging area . also , because the upper water jacket has a relatively small volume , the load on the core parts supporting the core part for defining the upper water jacket can be reduced , and the overall mechanical strength of the core can be improved . by extending the water jackets to the converging area , the cooling efficiency can be improved even further .",0,0,0,0,0,0
"a nighttime automatic illuminating device for telephones comprises a call detection circuit , an illumination detection circuit , an automatic illumination signal circuit , a driving means for automatic illumination light , a trigger pulse generation circuit , a lights - off delay timer circuit and a power source circuit , through which ring signals of telephones and telephones &# 39 ; being in current use or not can be detected . also , through linking the illumination detection circuit and the call detection circuit , the nighttime automatic illuminating device for telephones can further be enabled to provide with secure and efficient illumination by corresponding to various degrees of illumination from the surrounding environment .",0,0,0,0,0,0
"a edge for attaching to a moldboard , having a rearwardly protruding trailing wear plate is disclosed . this device can be manufactured as one piece incorporating the standard edge and additional trailing wear plate or can be in the form of a bolt - on trailing wear plate that would become a component of a standard moldboard edge . the edge is applicable to motor graders , snowploughs or any other machine or attachment that performs similar functions . the trailing wear plate prolongs edge life , reduces grader bounce , enhances grader stability , reduces operator fatigue , allows greater moldboard control , enables greater grading speed and when these factors are combined offer substantial increased efficiency .",0,0,0,0,0,0
