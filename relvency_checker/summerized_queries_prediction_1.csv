0,0,The app keeps track of the degree of user's compliance and analyzes the data to determine the optimum lengths of work and break intervals. It reminds users to take appropriate breaks. The user has an option to override the app's suggestions for how long a break they should take.,0.19802047312259674,85.51998311,51,34.51998311
1,1,A nursing cushion with built-in privacy panels that gives breastfeeding mothers some private space. The cushion is u-shaped and has a pillow case as well as soft stuffing material. The infant is held upright on the pillow and kept close to the mother's body.,0.16247057914733887,88.21041006,47,41.21041006
2,2,The source and drain that are created from the electrode parts are created when they are perfectly aligned. The gap between the electrodes can be minimized by using spacer technology to create a space between them.,0.24154728651046753,87.47157969,36,51.47157969
3,3,The invention allows for the production of S. achromogenes before subjecting them to an antibiotic challenge. Location of the resultant gene directly in the chromosomal host dna can be aided by the use of temperature-sensitive plasmids or other curable vectors.,0.06506430357694626,84.33632661,41,43.33632661
4,4,"The invention involves coating work items in a vacuum treatment system with an arc vaporization source. Material is vaporized using an arc that is operated by an arc current utilizing the first electrode. In a multilayer system, metal ion bombardment is used either to pretreat the work pieces or to inject metal ions onto a substrate surface.",0.07848601043224335,88.47789092,57,31.477890919999993
5,5,"Yarn is made by winding undrawn yarn on a bobbin and spinning it with a spinnerette. The yarn is then drawn between godet rollers via a convection oven without being wound, imparting no twist to the yarn.",0.07286166399717331,83.99089666,37,46.990896660000004
6,6,"The fluorinated block copolyester includes blocks of fluoroether modified aromatic polyester and blocks of unmodified polyester, and the non-fluorinated polyester. Films, fibers, and molded components can all be manufactured from copolyesters to create formed products.",0.16437745094299316,56.13110858,36,20.131108580000003
7,7,The tensile strength of dmdheu fabric has been increased from 14. 5 to 10. 7 kg (table 17) as a result of being treated with dithylamidic acid.,0.6505945324897766,0.0,0,0.0
8,8,"Wet end rush transfer and the throughdrying fabric design, respectively, take the place of the traditional yankee functions of constructing machine direction and cross - machine direction stretch. It is especially beneficial to create the tissue with fibers that have undergone chemimechanical treatment in at least one layer.",0.22277668118476868,75.87837803,47,28.878378029999993
9,9,A high-performance sun control film is converted into thin filaments as part of the process for making sun control textile. A weaving machine weaves the filaments and joins them with other threads to create a textile that blocks the sun's rays. Varying ways of connecting the solar control film yarns result in different visible light transmittance and sun control effects.,0.039831358939409256,93.93121781,62,31.931217810000007
10,10,"Yarn is stored on a drum-shaped storage body of a feeding device by an electrical winding drive with relative rotational movements between a winding element and the storage body. During resting intervals, a backturn detent device prevents the winding element from rotating in the opposite direction.",0.05295893922448158,104.77569139,47,57.775691390000006
11,11,"Fancy yarn is spun using a process that ensures consistency between the produced fancy yarn and its desired configuration. A sensor device in a spinning mechanism continuously measures the diameter of the fancy yarn. Based on the measured diameter values, the fancy configuration of the created yarn is determined and compared to the specified fancy configuration.",0.02227393351495266,87.46053541,56,31.460535410000006
