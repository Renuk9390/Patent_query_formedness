0,0,A workplace timer app that initiates work and break intervals for a person to follow. It reminds users to take appropriate breaks. The user has an option to override the app's suggestions. The app keeps tracks of the degree of user's compliance and analyzes the data to determine the optimum lengths of work and break intervals.,0.14966243505477905,79.0719177,58
1,1,a nursing cushion with built-in privacy panels that gives breastfeeding mothers some private space. The cushion is u-shaped and has a pillow case as well as soft stuffing material. The pillow is kept close to the mother with the help of a neck strap. The infant is held upright on the pillow and kept close to the mother's body. The pillow may be stored and transported easily by folding it back on itself.,0.10982268303632736,82.40247446,76
2,2,"To create a space between nano-electrode sections, the center of a nano-wire or nano-electrode may be carved. The pieces might come together to form a single electron transistor. The source and drain that are created from the electrode parts are perfectly aligned. The gap between the electrodes can be minimized utilizing spacer technology.",0.05998927354812622,62.96737792,56
3,3,It is revealed a more effective method for amplifying DNA sequences. The method of the invention makes it possible to produce tandemly repeated gene sequences. One inserts a chosen foreign gene sequence into a fraction of S. achromogenes before subjecting the recombinant segment to an antibiotic challenge. The location of the resultant gene directly in the chromosomal host dna can be aided by the use of temperature-sensitive plasmids or other curable vectors.,0.007598880212754011,85.55208404,73
4,4,"The method described by the invention involves coating work items in a vacuum treatment system with an arc vaporization source that includes a first electrode that is embodied as a target. Material is vaporized using an arc that is operated by an arc current utilizing the first electrode. A bias voltage is delivered to a bias electrode that holds the work pieces and a second electrode that is implemented as a work piece holder. In a multilayer system, metal ion bombardment is used either to pretreat the work pieces or in at least one transition from one layer to an adjacent layer, in order to inject metal ions onto a substrate surface or a layer of a multilayer system rather than causing a major material removal or accumulation.",0.045093853026628494,106.10278622,128
5,5,"a method and tools for making polypropylene polymer into multifilament yarn. The procedure includes winding the undrawn yarn on a bobbin and spinning an undrawn yarn with a spinnerette. The yarn is then drawn between godet rollers via a convection oven without being wound, imparting no twist to the yarn. The drawn yarn is then wound on a bobbin.",0.01881789229810238,74.8091718,59
6,6,"the fluorinated block copolyester includes blocks of fluoroether modified aromatic polyester and blocks of unmodified polyester, and the non-fluorinated polyester. the disclosed shaped items are made from these polymer blends. A blockiness index, b, between 0 and 1 is what acceptable block copolyesters have. Films, fibers, and molded components can all be manufactured from copolyesters to create formed products.",0.10036228597164154,36.67473117,60
7,7,"As the dmdheu /(dmdheu + tmm) ratio rises from 0 / 7 to 7 / 7, the fabric's tensile strength drops from 14. 5 to 10. 7 kg ( table 17 ). previously studied cotton cloth that has been dmdheu treated.",0.28090906143188477,0.0,0
8,8,"Without the use of a yankee dryer, soft throughdried tissues that are suitable for use as high-end washroom tissues can be produced. Wet end rush transfer and the throughdrying fabric design, respectively, take the place of the traditional yankee functions of constructing machine direction and cross - machine direction stretch. It is especially beneficial to create the tissue with fibers that have undergone chemimechanical treatment in at least one layer. the tissues that arise from this have great mass and low rigidity.",0.06708002835512161,65.18563686,82
9,9,"a high transmittance sun control textile and a method of making it. A high-performance sun control film is converted into thin filaments as part of the process for making sun control textile. A weaving machine weaves the thin filaments and joins them with other threads to create a textile that blocks the sun's rays. Varying ways of connecting the sun control film yarns result in different visible light transmittance and sun control effects of the sun control textile, allowing for the creation of textiles with good sun control and high transmittance.",0.01439528726041317,90.44778302,93
10,10,"During each resting period a holding torque is generated in the winding direction when yarn is initially stored on a drum-shaped storage body of a feeding device by an electrical winding drive with relative rotational movements between a winding element and the storage body, with running periods and resting periods. The winding drive mechanism produces the holding torque electronically. During resting intervals, a backturn detent device prevents the winding element from rotating in the opposite direction. During each resting interval, a holding current activates the backturn detent device.",0.1516302227973938,94.31452666,89
11,11,"a process that enhances the consistency between the produced fancy yarn and its desired configuration. After being manufactured, the fancy yarn is fed via a sensor device in a spinning mechanism, which continuously measures the diameter of the fancy yarn. Based on the measured diameter values, the fancy configuration of the created yarn is determined and compared to the specified fancy configuration. The comparison is done repeatedly until there is a good match between the predetermined fancy configuration and the fancy configuration of the optimized, generated yarn.",0.00848248042166233,62.41099891,87
