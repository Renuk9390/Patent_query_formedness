# Patetn_query_formedness
Recent research in applying deep learning to the problem of prior-art searching has enabled development of easy-to-use prior-art search engines that accept natural language search queries and provide improved search performance. However, as opposed to the conventional keyword-based techniques where the results are readily explained by the presence of queried keywords, deep-learning based techniques act like a black box. As a result, it is difficult for users to understand how to articulate their information need as a high-quality search query to obtain optimal results. In this paper we share insights on this problem from extensive experimentation with PQAI, an open source deep learning based prior-art search engine. We study the effects of various query parameters such as verbosity, grammar, and specificity on the search results and show that ill-formed queries containing grammatical errors, non-essential content, and broad terminology adversely affect relevance of search results. We also develop and benchmark a number of machine learning models, viz. Grammatical Error Detection Model (GEDM), Query Specificity Model (QSM), and Query Verbosity Model (QVM), to identify and mitigate commonly encountered issues with ill-formed queries.
